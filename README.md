 A self-driving car, or autonomous vehicle, utilizes advanced sensors, cameras, radar, and artificial intelligence to navigate and drive without human intervention. Equipped with sophisticated software, it processes real-time data to detect obstacles, interpret traffic signals, and make driving decisions. These vehicles use GPS for navigation and machine learning algorithms to continually improve performance. Self-driving cars promise to enhance road safety, reduce traffic congestion, and provide greater mobility for those unable to drive. They represent a significant leap forward in automotive technology, aiming to revolutionize transportation by making it safer, more efficient, and accessible.
